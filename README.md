Analyzed a large-scale e-commerce dataset (100K+ records) covering customers, orders, and sellers to uncover actionable business insights and apply machine learning techniques for customer churn detection and review score prediction. The project aims to provide businesses with data-driven strategies to minimize churn and improve retention.

ðŸš€ Key Components

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Investigated customer, seller, and order trends

Identified top-performing product categories and buying patterns

Explored payment behaviors, demographics, and delivery performance

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Addressed missing values using forward-fill and median imputation

Engineered new features such as delivery time, order status, and review metrics

Churn Analysis:

Built predictive models to detect churn-prone customers

Revealed an overall 12% churn rate with insights for retention strategies

Review Score Prediction:

Implemented Random Forest Regression for rating prediction

Achieved MSE = 0.365, highlighting major factors influencing reviews

Visual Analytics:

Visualized customer trends and sales growth over time

Mapped top categories and most common cancellation reasons

Displayed churn distribution and customer behavior patterns
